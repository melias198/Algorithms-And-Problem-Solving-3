An algorithm to add two numbers: 

1. Take two number inputs
2. Add numbers using the + operator
3. Display the result

A graph is a unique data structure in programming that consists of finite sets of nodes or vertices and a set of edges that connect these vertices to them. At this moment, adjacent vertices can be called those vertices that are connected to the same edge with each other.
