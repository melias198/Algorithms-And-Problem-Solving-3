# Algorithms
```
In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired output. For example,

An algorithm to add two numbers: 

1. Take two number inputs
2. Add numbers using the + operator
3. Display the result
```

# Graphs
```
A graph is a unique data structure in programming that consists of finite sets of nodes or vertices and a set of edges that connect these vertices to them. At this moment, adjacent vertices can be called those vertices that are connected to the same edge with each other.
